                Now this is a story all about how<br/>
                My life got flipped turned upside down<br/>
                And I'd like to take a minute, just sit right there<br/>
                I'll tell you how I became the prince of a town called Bel-Air
            </p>
            <p>
                In West Philadelphia born and raised<br/>
                On the playground is where I spent most of my days<br/>
                Chilling out, maxing, relaxing all cool<br/>
                And all shooting some b-ball outside of the school<br/>
                When a couple of guys who were up to no good<br/>
                Started making trouble in my neighborhood<br/>
                I got in one little fight and my mom got scared<br/>
                And said "You're moving with your auntie and uncle in Bel-Air"<br/>
                I begged and pleaded with her day after day<br/>
                But she packed my suitcase and sent me on my way<br/>
                She gave me a kiss and then she gave me my ticket<br/>
                I put my Walkman on and said "I might as well kick it"<br/>
                First class, yo, this is bad<br/>
                Drinking orange juice out of a champagne glass<br/>
                Is this what the people of Bel-Air living like?<br/>
                Hmm, this might be all right<br/>
                But wait, I hear they're prissy, bourgeois, and all that<br/>
                Is this the type of place that they should send this cool cat?<br/>
                I don't think so, I'll see when I get there<br/>
                I hope they're prepared for the Prince of Bel-Air
            </p>
            <p>
                Well, uh<br/>
                The plane landed and when I came out<br/>
                There was a dude, looked like a cop, standing there with my name out<br/>
                I ain't trying to get arrested yet, I just got here<br/>
                I sprang with the quickness like lightning, disappeared<br/>
                I whistled for a cab and when it came near<br/>
                The license plate said 'Fresh' and it had dice in the mirror<br/>
                If anything I could say that this cab was rare<br/>
                But I thought "Nah, forget it, yo, Holmes, to Bel-Air!"
            </p>
            <p>
                I pulled<br/>
                Up to a house about seven or eight<br/>
                And I yelled to the cabbie "Yo', Holmes, smell ya later"<br/>
                Looked at my kingdom, I was finally there<br/>
                To sit on my throne as the Prince of Bel-Air
            </p>
